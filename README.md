### Leek_Error

This is a fork of [FFFUU-Exception](https://github.com/kurtschwarz/FFFUU-Exception) error handler by [kurtschwarz](https://github.com/kurtschwarz).
I loved the design but wanted something that could easily drop in to any of my Zend Framework projects (and wasn't NSFW) - so here it is.
See [this image](http://i.imgur.com/lFjwF.jpg) for a reference of what this error handler looks like.

## Reference
